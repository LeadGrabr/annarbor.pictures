        Grandma and Grandpa live in Ann Arbor, MI. They are aging.
        We live several states away from them all the way up in
        Vermont and do not get to see them often. But after working
        a part time job while being in my last year of university,
        I was able to save up some money to go see them. I realized
        that they did not have many pictures of themselves over the
        years. They were celebrating their sixtieth wedding
        anniversary, so I thought it would be nice for them to have
        some senior pictures taken to commemorate their anniversary.
        I paid for the photos. They appreciated it. And I have some
        of the photos for my own keepsake. They turned out really
        nice.
