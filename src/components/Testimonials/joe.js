        Well, I decided my dear wife and I needed some senior
        pictures. We have been married sixty eight years. Yes, we
        are getting old. But we still feel young at heart. We really
        appreciate how kind this photography company was to us. The
        photographer came to our cottage where I hosted a surprise
        ninetieth birthday party. My daughters and son helped me 
        with the party. Many came. All had a good time. The
        photographer took pictures of my wife with many of her
        friends and family members. There are pictures of her
        opening gifts, smiling, looking at the balloons and cutting
        the cake. There is one where we exchange a sweet kiss too.
        She says that is her favorite one! We just want to say
        thanks for making our pictures look so nice.
